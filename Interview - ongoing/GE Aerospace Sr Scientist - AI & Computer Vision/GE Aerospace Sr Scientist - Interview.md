00:10:03,440
I appreciate that thank you and I mean so high relevance with regards to a lot of what we do and in fact here let me I'll show you one slide that just kind of gives an overview of some of what we do and I think will hopefully give you a sense for kind of how we operate the relevance here mhm so in terms of the team. 我很感激，謝謝你，我的意思是，這與我們所做的很多事情高度相關，事實上，在這裡，讓我給你看一張幻燈片，它只是概述了我們所做的一些事情，我想希望這能讓你了解我們如何運作相關性，嗯，就團隊而言。

![[GE Aerospace.jpg]]

00:10:27,760
yep so we're doing fundamental and applied research it's um a lot of academic style research on the for the fundamental side where it's blue sky advancing the state-of-the-art intended for publications and patents things where we're really aiming to um just see what is possible and and advance new concepts um that's about half of what we do and then the other half is on the applied side is something that is tied to more specific business problems that we have um the the areas that dominate that uh tie into uh inspection um<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;"> health monitoring</mark> and then in uh <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">human interactive systems</mark> and best way to think of it is so we manufacture jet engines and other equipment for aerospace right. 是的，我們正在進行基礎研究和應用研究，嗯，我們在基礎方面進行了很多學術風格的研究，這是藍天，推進最先進的技術，旨在出版和申請專利，我們真正的目標是嗯，看看什麼是可能的，並推進新的概念嗯，這大大約是我們工作的一半，另一半是應用方面的，與更具體的業務問題相關，我們嗯，主導的領域嗯，與檢查嗯，健康監測相關，然後在嗯，人機交互系統相關，最好的思考方式是我們製造噴氣發動機和其他航空航天設備。

00:11:14,800
so we we're the biggest manufacturer of jet engines in the world we you know something like if I remember correctly it's 2.3 billion people every year fly somewhere on our equipment um and you know so we in the process of that we've got a lot of activities related to um <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">process control and quality quality assurance in manufacturing</mark> itself so that's either in situ um say vibration and and other monitoring that can happen while a process is underway as well as <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">inspection at various stages</mark> of manufacturing um as something is a new made part and then once something is in use the idea is to both <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">observe it in in use for purposes of things like optimal control and planning</mark> um but also to understand when possible <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">when to inspect</mark> for more detailed information for things like maintenance scheduling and work scope okay uh even even for like inventory planning for replacement parts and the like uh 我們是世界上最大的噴射引擎製造商，如果我沒記錯的話，每年有 23億人乘坐我們的設備飛往世界各地，嗯，所以在這個過程中，我們有很多與<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">過程控制和品質保證相關</mark>的活動，所以這要么是現場，嗯，比如說振動和其他在過程進行時可能發生的監控，要么是在製造的<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">各個階段進行的檢查</mark>，嗯，因為某個東西是新製造的零件，然後一旦某個東西投入使用，我們的想法是既要<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">觀察它的使用情況，以便進行最佳控制和規劃</mark>，嗯，也要了解<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">何時進行檢查</mark>，以獲取更詳細的信息，例如維護計劃和工作範圍，甚至包括更換零件的庫存計劃等。

00:12:32,079
so as you can imagine that actually goes across many different modalities of capture it covers everything from um <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">traditional time series</mark> <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">of things like uh high frequency stuff like vibes lower frequency things like pressures and temperatures</mark> that get observed in in use um but it also includes uh computer vision problems where we've got <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">electroloptical or IR imaging um CT scans</mark> as well for for various things especially including uh additively manufactured parts so you get extremely complex geometries that would be very difficult to traditionally inspect with visible light approaches because of the the difficulty to actually access the critical aspects of it and so as you can imagine anything which can provide essentially an X-ray or you know any penetrative system that can uh attempt to understand the inner pieces of it for purposes of determining quality or blockage or problems that might be underway okay yep 你可以想像，這實際上涉及許多不同的捕獲模式，涵蓋了從<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">傳統的時間序列</mark>，<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">比如高頻振動，到低頻，比如在使用中觀察到的壓力和溫度</mark>，但它也包括計算機視覺問題，我們有<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">光電或紅外成像，還有 CT 掃描</mark>，用於各種事物，特別是包括增材製造的部件，所以你會得到一個複雜的幾何形狀，這些關鍵形狀很難用它可以檢查X 射線的東西，或任何可以嘗試了解其內部結構的穿透系統，以確定質量、堵塞或可能正在發生的問題，好的，是的

00:13:23,839
yeah so we do plenty of stuff in that space um and then that ties into a lot of forecasting and future so like <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">discrete event simulation and probabilistic forecasting um for what essentially approximately optimal decision</mark>-m so human decision- making for uh things like inventory or maintenance activities um to understand uh and support uh condition based maintenance really for that's that's kind of like the ultimate target for everything is that you're you're only doing work on it when it needs to be done and it's the minimal scope of what needs to be done i see but it should be proactive in terms of what's going on to avoid any concern um but ultimately like because this is highly regulated environment it's a environment for critical infrastructure um everything else there's a high degree of human engagement so explainable uh AI um AI that is specifically targeted at generation of uh artifacts that are used in things like certification processes or in airline engagements or other like formal uh settings it's a it's a frequent area where we are providing capabilities that need to have that as the end goal in mind it's not just that it needs to be making a good call but it needs to be making a good call for a reason with that reason being totally transparent okay so we actually have quite a bit of fundamental research in um explanability and verifiability of uh AI systems okay. 是的，我們在這個領域做了很多事情，嗯，然後這與很多預測和未來息息相關，比如<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">離散事件模擬和概率預測，嗯，本質上是近似最優決策</mark>，所以人類的決策，比如庫存或維護活動，嗯，是為了理解和支持基於條件的維護，這有點像一切的最終目標，你只在需要做的時候才去做，這是我認為需要做的最小範圍，但它應該積極主動地了解正在發生的事情，以避免任何擔憂，嗯，但最終，因為這是一個高度監管的環境，這是一個關鍵基礎設施的環境，嗯，其他一切都有高度的人為參與，所以可以解釋嗯，人工智能，嗯，人工智能，專門針對生成用於認證流程、航空公司參與或其他類似正式場合的工件，這是一個我們提供功能的常見領域，需要將此作為最終目標它不僅需要做出正確的判斷，而且需要出於某種原因做出正確的，而這個原因

00:14:59,600
so yeah um I have a question so I think I I saw the slide talk about a healthy modeling so it is some I'm not quite understand about this part 是的，嗯，我有一個問題，所以我想我看到了幻燈片上關於健康模型的討論，所以我對這部分不太理解


00:15:24,399
sure so <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">diagnostics and prognostics for systems</mark> so uh given expectations for uh what we anticipate we should be seeing for some piece of equipment whether it be uh electrical mechanical whatever it could be so for instance I'll give you a real concrete example okay um we every engine that is going to go into service has to undergo testing acceptance testing so but rigorous testing before it leaves our facilities to start with but as well as testing again after it's completed any service or manu or uh repair activity before it gets returned to use um during those test activities we need to make sure that we understand exactly how it's operating and we have an AIdriven watchdog system that makes sure that it's done safely so essentially what it's doing is it is <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">monitoring the current state of um the expected performance of the engine as it underos a variety of different uh test conditions and it is comparing the manifold of expected performance and the regions of expected performance for the specific control signals it has against </mark>what it's actually observing um and we actually have three redundant systems that look at that so one which is purely performance model based and different so essentially you're looking for the the delta between the two uh across a high dimensional vector um one which is am causal system that's attempting to look for um progress progressive changes in uh observable information based upon changes in control 當然，<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">系統診斷和預測是必要</mark>的，所以，考慮到我們對某些設備（無論是電氣設備還是機械設備）的預期，例如，我給你舉一個非常具體的例子，我們<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">每台即將投入使用的發動機都必須經過測試驗收測試</mark>，但在離開我們的設施之前，除了在完成任何服務、製造或維修活動後再次進行測試外，還要在<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">重新投入使用之前進行測試</mark>。在這些測試活動中，我們需要確保我們完全了解它的運作方式，我們有一個由人工智慧驅動的看門狗系統，可以確保它安全地完成，所以它本質上的作用是<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">監控引擎在各種不同測試條件下的預期性能的當前狀態，並將預期性能的多樣性和特定控制訊號的預期性能區域與實際觀察到的結果進行比較。我們實際上有三個冗餘系統來監控這些情況，其中一個是純粹的效能模型</mark>。本質上，你正在尋找高維度向量之間的差異，這是一個因果系統，它試圖基於控制的變化來尋找可觀察資訊的漸進變化。

00:16:47,360
changes in control so you know the throttle is increased you anticipate you will see a higher fuel flow you know higher temperatures increased pressures etc um do you see them at the rate that you would anticipate and the progression through the stages of the engine that you would anticipate um but also one which is looking at sensor health and attempting to discover sensor drift or dropout or intermittency um so we have all of those running simultaneously so that if there's a test condition and something does not go as planned it can automatically shut off uh the it can terminate the test cut off fuel uh execute a controlled stop immediately um to essentially ensure safety for that engine um that you can imagine those are things that also can be used on wing um and to some degree they are but we have highly we have more uh observability for an engine under test on the ground because there are there's a wide array of additional sensing that's essentially wrapped around it in the test environment there that is not available on when it's on an aircraft. so there's a bunch there in terms of model that's understanding the current state of health right 控制發生變化，所以你知道油門增加了，你預計你會看到更高的燃料流量，你知道更高的溫度增加了壓力等等，嗯，你是否看到它們以你預期的速率發展，以及你預期的發動機各個階段的進展，嗯，但同時也在查看傳感器的健康狀況，並試圖發現傳感器的漂移、丟失或間歇性，嗯，所以我們讓所有這些情況同時運行某些，這樣事情沒有按計劃進行，它可以自動關閉，嗯，它可以終止測試，切斷燃料，嗯，立即執行受控停止，嗯，從本質上確保發動機的安全，嗯，你可以想像這些東西也可以在機翼上使用，嗯，在某種程度上它們是，但我們對地面測試中的發動機有更多的可觀察性，因為在測試環境中，有各種各樣的傳感所以有很多模型可以理解當前的健康狀況

00:18:06,720
so that's attempting to to to<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> understand where in the life cycle of the of the equipment is it with regards to expectations of performance um to look forward we have a um a number of things from past experience with equipment in order to create prognostic systems that will attempt to estimate time till critical milestones</mark> for activity for that so times when we anticipate there'll be reduction in efficiency or performance of that that equipment times when we know that we need to have more detailed inspection to differentiate key populations so certain equipment you know once it gets to certain aging um there based upon manufacturing there may be different behaviors that you see for different manufacturing lots and the like uh and so we want to be able to tease that out very efficiently um as well as to understand when it would ultimately need to be replaced or repaired so a lot of that ties into uh basically high level opt optimization activities that are maximizing availability of the equipment and minimizing total cost of ownership um 所以，我們試<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">著了解設備在生命週期中處於什麼階段，以及對效能的預期。展望未來，我們根據過去的設備使用經驗，總結出了一些經驗，以便創建預測系統</mark>，該系統將嘗試估算距離關鍵里程碑的時間。因此，當我們預期設備的效率或性能會下降時，我們知道需要進行更詳細的檢查以區分關鍵人群，因此，某些設備一旦老化，根據製造流程的不同，不同的製造批次可能會有不同的行為。因此，我們希望能夠非常有效地梳理出這些情況，並了解最終何時需要更換或維修。這在很大程度上與高級優化活動有關，這些活動可以最大限度地提高設備的可用性，並最大限度地降低總擁有成本。

00:19:25
we do a lot uh in terms of the way that the company operates financially in terms of taking on risk associated with equipment that is sold so it's very very big very expensive very critical equipment so the idea is that um for most of the service activities rather than just doing like replacement parts or parts and labor type uh agreements more and more situations what we're doing is we're actually selling equipment but then also selling contractual service agreements which have a continuou funding string associated with them and we essentially take on that contractual risk we say "Hey you're going to have an engine at all times if that engine has a problem you get a replacement from us and we will take care of the the one that needs to be taken care of 我們在公司財務運營方面做了很多工作，承擔與所售設備相關的風險，這些設備非常非常大，非常昂貴，非常關鍵，所以我們的想法是，對於大多數服務活動，而不僅僅是提供更換零件或零件和人工之類的協議，在越來越多的情況下，我們實際上在銷售設備，但也銷售合約服務協議，這些協議與持續的資金鏈相關，我們基本上承擔了合約風險，我們說：“嘿，你將一直擁有一台發動機，如果該發動機出現問題，你可以從我們這裡獲得替換件，我們將負責處理需要處理的那台發動機。”

00:20:11,039
Um but as the OEM for it we have a lot of a lot of data that nobody has access to but us we have everything from the original design documents associated with the manufacturer through the digital thread of its manufacturing itself into the actual operational history and so being able to do um activities that can minimize the cost expedite the return to to service um you know take care of it as efficiently as possible that's something that we are uniquely set up to do so 嗯，但是作為它的原始設備製造商，我們擁有大量數據，除了我們之外，沒有人可以訪問這些數據，我們擁有從與製造商相關的原始設計文檔到其製造本身的數字線程再到實際操作歷史記錄的所有內容，因此能夠執行可以最大程度降低成本的活動，加快恢復服務的速度，嗯，你知道，盡可能高效地處理它，這是我們的獨特之處

00:20:41,760
it's not it's not unlike how uh you see that even with like cars so car dealerships attempt to do that but there they there are many places that can buy those same parts and provide the same service um and they compete on price with regards to those activities because there are not people who can make the same parts that that are approved andor they cannot make them at the scale and the efficiency that we can nor do they have the de the critical information needed to make them operate effectively in the environments we need them to in a safe and compliant fashion with our regulators that we dominate the service environment for our work as well so there are third party services that we work with to some degree but we we are still the biggest service provider as well for for anything that we do 這和你看到的汽車經銷商的做法不一樣，雖然他們也試圖這樣做，但有很多地方可以買到同樣的零件，提供同樣的服務，而且他們在價格上競爭，因為沒有人可以製造經過批准的相同零件，他們無法像我們一樣大規模高效地生產，也沒有關鍵資訊來確保他們在我們需要的環境中以安全合規的方式有效運行，我們也在監管機構的監管下主導著我們的工作環境，所以在某種程度上，我們也與第三方服務合作，但我們仍然是最大的服務提供商，無論我們做什麼，是的

00:21:37,280
yeah from like a technical perspective like it drives a variety of challenges right so we've got technical challenges on just how do we understand the world in ways that we can reason and make decisions effectively yes but it even feeds into things that are ultimately business critical for how is this actually going to get people the equipment they need at the time they need um because at the end of the day if a if an airplane sits idle and is not able to be used it can be it can cost an airline like a million dollars a day in terms of loss productivity um yeah and like I said we we're the biggest one for that and we make all these other critical systems and navigations and communication systems we make all sorts of defense systems that are highly valuable um and so being able to make things that have consistent and effective trust associated with them is I see very important to what we do yeah 是的，從技術角度來看，它會帶來各種各樣的挑戰，對吧？所以我們面臨的技術挑戰是如何理解世界，以便我們能夠有效地推理和決策。是的，但它甚至會影響到最終對業務至關重要的事情，即如何在人們需要的時候為他們提供所需的設備，因為歸根結底，如果一架飛機閒置而無法使用，那麼航空公司每天可能會損失一百萬美元的生產力，嗯，是的，就像我說的，我們是這方面最大的公司，我們製造所有其他關鍵系統、導航和通訊系統，我們製造各種非常有價值的防禦系統，所以能夠製造出與它們相關的一致和有效的信任的東西，我認為對我們的工作非常重要。

00:22:37,919
I have a follow-up question just um it is just like um uh for example for some project uh inspection and maybe the quality and also maybe control system I think they already have some traditional way to do that and um yeah so I want to understand that um so what's the reason we introduce the AI or or is it already a very just already uh just develop a good model 我有一個後續問題，嗯，就像嗯，例如對於一些項目呃檢查，也許是質量，也許是控制系統，我認為他們已經有了一些傳統的方法來做到這一點，嗯，是的，所以我想了解嗯，所以我們引入人工智能的原因是什麼，或者它已經是一個非常好的模型了

00:23:07,760
it's a Good question but no we aren't so we we do benchmark with current state-of-the-art right we always are going to look at what the current you know like we'll look at what a you know a traditional CNN based system you know a ResNet or UNET or whatnot and what have you might do in order for its efficacy for solving a particular problem there is often more innovation required so whether that be um<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;"> novelty in terms of the network novelty in the learning um you know the the data augmentation that's needed um even the capture conditions</mark> if there if we are talking about something with say robotic uh or or autonomous capture so there's we're looking to move it not just to solve the you know repeatedly solve the same detection you know problems over and over again that's that's low value for us as a research center i will say as a company we do plenty of that and we actually have a data science group that we work with who take a lot of the tools and technologies that we build and mature them to high techn higher technical readiness levels and deploy them but those are not typically the research center itself we're looking at what are novel approaches in these spaces such that we can explore um relevant 這是個好問題，但我們並沒有這樣做，所以我們會以目前最先進的技術為基準，我們總是會關注當前的技術，例如我們會關注傳統的基於 CNN 的系統，例如 ResNet 或 UNET等等，為了提高它解決特定問題的效率，通常需要更多的創新，無論<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">是網絡方面的創新，學習方面的創新，還是所需的數據增強，甚至是捕獲條件</mark>，如果我們談論的是機器人或自動捕獲之類的東西，那麼我們希望移動它，而不僅僅是解決一遍又一遍地解決相同的檢測問題，這對於我們作為研究中心來說價值很低，我想說，作為一家公司，我們做了很多這樣的事情，我們實際上有一個數據科學小組，他們利用我們構建的許多工具和技術，並將它們完善到高科技、更高的技術就緒水平並進行部署，但這些通常不是研究中心我們正在研究這些領域的新方法，以便我們能夠探索相關的

00:24:22,240
so for instance like mhm if you wanted to do inspection one of the critical things you want to do in inspection is you want to do not just detection and localization but you actually want to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">do measurement and so that requires things like the ability to look at pose estimation as it relates to the known CAD model as you relate that to a point cloud or and there are different ways you can approach that in terms of like essentially distance distance from mesh</mark> uh as well has uh aspects there where you're where you are doing like<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;"> differential rendering</mark> um or or other takes to to do that either some of those are <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">moninocular based on the way that we capture some are stereoscopic or time of flight</mark> even you know we have a variety of different ways that we might have captured differentn interesting data that we're looking to then relate to knowledge that we already have yep 舉個例子，嗯，如果你想做檢查，你在檢查中要做的關鍵事情之一就是<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">你不僅要進行檢測和定位，還要進行測量，所以這需要能夠查看姿態估計，因為它與已知的 CAD模型相關，就像你把它與點雲關聯起來一樣，或者有不同的方式來處理這個問題，比如本質上是距離網格的距離</mark>，嗯，還有一些方面，比如你在做什麼，比如<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">差分渲染</mark>，或者其他需要做的事情，其中​​一些是<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">基於我們捕捉方式的單目圖像，一些是立體的，或者飛行時間</mark>，甚至你知道我們已有不同的方法聯繫起來

00:25:15,360
have yep um so yeah we everybody's doing new stuff um the team on average publishes everybody typically publishes about one paper per year give or take okay um it varies because you know some people publish more some a little less there isn't like a hard requirement around it uh it's not it's it's sort of a secondary signal for the actual successive research from our perspective because the point of our research isn't to just just advance the state of the art but to actually do something with it so it's things like IP capture is a higher strength signal you know how many patents what are the patents on but also the work that we have that then gets picked up by different portions of our different business units to actually turn it into either internal or external products and services um because that's you know that's where somebody has nowm taken the technology commercialized it and commoditized it commoditized it enough that they they are able to do it repeatedly in in a way that makes sense 是的，嗯，是的，我們每個人都在做新的東西，嗯，團隊平均每年都會發表一篇論文，大概就是這樣，嗯，這取決於每個人，因為你知道，有些人發表的多一些，有些人發表的少一些，並沒有硬性要求，嗯，這不是，從我們的角度來看，這是實際連續研究的技術，因為我們研究的目的不僅僅是推進最先進的技術。一些事情，所以像IP捕獲這樣的事情是一個更高強度的信號，你知道有多少專利，這些專利是什麼，還有我們所擁有的工作，然後被我們不同業務部門的不同部分採用，實際上將其轉化為內部或外部的產品和服務，嗯，因為你知道，這就是現在有人將技術商業化和商品化的地方，商品化到足以讓他們能夠以合理的方式重複這樣做。


00:26:56,159
we're doing quite a bit in foundation models as well so both modification of existing foundation models but also novel creation of foundation models across different domains and the ability to ar orchestrate interesting uh agentic frameworks that make use of a variety of different specialized systems that that are built on foundation models as well so we've we've got quite a variety of research that we're doing from this perspective we've got 20 full-time researchers in my team um looking to grow to probably about 23 by the end of the year um and uh yeah but the folks that here have been here for quite some time for the most part um I've so I I've been growing the team slowly over the last couple years um but increasingly now I'm looking to to build it up especially because there's it's just such a rich field for things for us to do and um yeah but like I've been here 12 years the average years of service is a little north of eight yeah people come and they stay because if you think about it we're a research center serving many aspects of a large business and so we we have a wide variety of problems that we can hit which means you don't get bored and you don't feel like you get pigeonholed in terms of the activities you work on or the the research you do 我們在基礎模型方面也做了不少工作，既修改了現有的基礎模型，也創建了跨不同領域的新穎基礎模型，並且能夠編排有趣的代理框架，這些框架利用了基於基礎模型構建的各種不同專用系統。因此，從這個角度來看，我們正在進行各種各樣的研究。我的團隊中有 20 名全職研究人員，預計今年底將成長到 23 名左右。嗯，是的，但是這裡的大多數人已經在這裡工作了很長時間。嗯，過去幾年我一直在慢慢壯大團隊。嗯，但現在我越來越希望能夠壯大團隊，特別是因為這是一個非常豐富的領域，我們可以做很多事情。嗯，是的，但是我已經在這裡工作了 12 年，平均服務年限略高於 8 年。是的，人們來到這裡並留下來，因為如果你想想的話，我們是一個為大型企業的許多方面提供服務的研究中心。我們有各種各樣的問題可以解決，這意味著你不會感到無聊，也不會覺得你在從事的活動或研究方面受到限制

00:28:18,159
so I have people who you know they get to explore you know<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;"> language understanding</mark> for automatic manual translations versus and then they'll also get to look at you know <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">quantitative microscopy</mark> and materials discovery and hypothesis problems or you know like uh <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">robotic control</mark> for additive new additively manufactured parts like we've got all sorts of different things that we're that we're working on and people can work on all of them i mean not all at once but like that's good yeah the the the point of the team isn't for people to be like you know one thing that they do and that's all they do i see so okay um so I did want to 所以我有一些人，你知道他們可以<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">探索語言理解</mark>，用於自動手動翻譯，然後他們還可以研究<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">定量顯微鏡和材料</mark>發現和假設問題，或者你知道，比如<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">機器人控制</mark>用於增材製造的新型增材製造部件，我們有各種各樣的東西，我們正在研究，人們可以研究所有這些，我的意思是不是一次性的，但那很好，是一次性的，團隊的意義不在於讓人們所做的

00:28:58,159
before we run out of time I wanted to let you know the way that the interview process works is um we we have this conversation now to kind of give you some background a little bit about what we are who we're what we're doing um after this uh I'm going to send you an email looking for uh actually Misty probably will looking for times for um technical interviewing with a couple of the members of my team okay um some of the more senior folks on the team to talk through your technical background understand your relative strengths and weaknesses your areas that you are a deep expert in to understand both where you could drop into existing work but also where you are complimentary like you could be well beyond our capabilities in different areas okay um and then after that conversation we go through to on-site interviewing which is um it's about 6 to8 hours you get a chance to meet the whole team um give a give a talk about some of the work that you've done um yes it's relatively relatively chill 在時間用完之前，我想讓你了解面試流程。嗯，我們現在進行這次談話，是為了讓你了解我們的背景，我們是誰，我們在做什麼。嗯，之後，我會給你發一封電子郵件，希望你……實際上，Misty 可能會找時間與我的團隊中的幾位成員進行技術面試。嗯，一些團隊中比較資深的人，了解你的技術背景，了解你的相對優勢和劣勢，了解你在哪些領域是資深專家，了解你可以在哪些方面融入現有工作，以及你在哪些方面可以互補，例如你可以在哪些領域超越我們的能力。嗯，在那次談話之後，我們會進行現場面試，嗯，大約 6 到 8 個小時，你有機會與整個團隊見面，嗯，談談你做過的一些工作，嗯，是的，相對來說比較輕鬆。

00:30:00,799
okay sounds great um so do you have time for maybe my last question or of course okay last question just like so um for this position what kind of people you are looking for i mean for example um maybe technique maybe you it maybe focus on model development or or deployment 好的，聽起來不錯，嗯，那你有時間回答我的最後一個問題嗎？或者當然，好的最後一個問題，就像嗯，對於這個職位，你在尋找什麼樣的人，我的意思是，例如，嗯，也許是技術，也許你可能專注於模型開發或部署

00:30:24,679
I'm looking for good scientists so beyond beyond that it doesn't matter because you know everything else is some people have varying levels of skills in different things like model building and parameter selection and you know like picking the right frameworks or the right uh types of models to build sure there's some intuition there there's some experience um there's programming skills right in terms of the ability to put together a complex system um but those are like being highly skilled in that can make you more efficient but what you need to be more to be effective in the role is largely to be a highly effective skeptical scientist so you can understand how something might be pursued experimentally because we're not just trying to solve problems where the solution is abundantly obvious we're trying to hypothesize var various like a variety of different means of trying things to solve it trying them out you know seeing whether it's using code code and models and things that we have that we find you know seeing how things work understanding capturing the knowledge from that in ways that we can then reexpress to other scientists so that we can then ultimately come to a some idea of okay well if you are in practice for this what does a solution look like um and so I always say that the number one skill beyond anything else has nothing to do with aerospace and very little even to do with AI is just being it is how you think scientifically in terms of your clarity of thought from from you know initial problem to hypothesis to experimental design uh to how you interpret and uh express and summarize results and then to convince others about that as well 我正在尋找優秀的科學家，所以除此之外，其他一切都無關緊要，因為您知道，有些人在不同方面擁有不同水平的技能，例如模型構建和參數選擇，您知道，例如選擇正確的框架或正確的模型類型來構建，確保有一些直覺，有一些經驗，嗯，還有程式設計技能，就組建複雜系統的能力而言，嗯，但這些就像是高超的技能，可以使您更有效率，但您更需要的是成為一名高效的懷疑論科學家，這樣您才能理解如何通過實驗進行某些事情，因為我們不僅試圖解決解決方案顯而易見的問題，我們還試圖假設各種不同的方法，例如嘗試解決問題，嘗試它們，看看它是否使用程式碼，程式碼和模型以及我們發現的東西，了解事物的工作原理，以某種方式從中獲取知識，然後我們可以向其他科學家重新表達，以便我們最終可以得出一些想法，好吧，如果你在實踐中，解決方案是什麼樣的，嗯，所以我總是說，最重要的技能與航空航天無關，甚至與人工智能也沒什麼關係，只是你如何科學地思考，從你最初的問題到假設，再到實驗設計，呃，你如何解釋、呃，表達和總結結果，然後說服別人
