Role Number:**200576118**

Do you love crafting elegant solutions to highly complex challenges? Are you a big-picture visionary who understands how each element affects all the others? At Apple, our Architecture group is responsible for connecting our hardware and software into one unified system. Join this team, and you’ll collaborate with engineers across Apple to design how all of our technologies work in unison! You’ll drive development of our renowned system-on-a-chip architecture and develop algorithms to improve image quality, enable new use cases, improve power and thermal performance, and enable new camera module technologies. You’ll develop forward-looking prototype systems as well as build and deploy software development tools that will be distributed to the Apple engineering community, and help build the seamless technology experiences we’re known for worldwide. In this role, you will model and help develop HW for the next generation of digital image processing, particularly related to consumer photography. Devise new processing techniques, combine traditional image processing with Machine Learning, invent hardware architectures, evaluate and debug new approaches, and develop practical implementations that are precisely specified. Work to get the most from new processing techniques, deliver state of the art image quality, evaluate and debug new approaches, and develop optimal ways to program our new hardware so our software teams work from a good starting place.

## 

Description

- Work with the other Image Signal Processor engineers to demonstrate what the newest hardware designs can do. - Develop a testing plan to prove that the architecture can produce high quality results. - Assist the firmware and camera teams with debugging and working around system problems. - Work with the power team to understand and improve the setup and use cases to enable the best image quality within our power budget. - Work with the image quality and software teams to understand their requirements and feed information back to the architects to improve the designs. - Create detailed hardware specifications suitable for efficient and practical implementation. - Model the specification in C++. - Work with tight deadlines.
