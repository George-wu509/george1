Tutorial: Fine-tuning RF-DETR for drone detection 🔥 🔥 🔥  
  
I’ve spent the last two weeks working on an end-to-end RF-DETR fine-tuning tutorial, and it’s finally here. You can use it to fine-tune RF-DETR on any dataset, not only drones.  
  
- Learn the COCO annotation format  
- Train RF-DETR in Google Colab  
- Adjust hyperparameters for optimal performance  
- Evaluate model accuracy  
- Save and deploy your trained model  
  
RF-DETR-N outperforms YOLO11-N by 10 mAP points on the COCO benchmark while also running faster at inference. RF-DETR is the top object detector on the RF100-VL benchmark, where RF-DETR-M beat YOLO11-M by an average of 5 mAP points across aerial datasets (drone, satellite, radar).  
  
Its mix of lightweight design, speed, and accuracy, combined with the open-source Apache 2.0 license, makes it an excellent choice for deployment on drones and other mobile devices.
