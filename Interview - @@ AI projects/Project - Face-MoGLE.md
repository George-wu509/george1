Generating realistic and controllable faces has always been a significant challenge in AI, requiring a delicate balance between semantic control and visual fidelity.  
  
New research from Beijing Jiaotong University, Ant Group, Qinghai University, and Tsinghua University introduces Face-MoGLE: "Mixture of Global and Local Experts with Diffusion Transformer for Controllable Face Generation."  
  
This paper presents a novel framework that tackles this head-on. Face-MoGLE introduces semantic-decoupled latent modeling for precise attribute manipulation, a Mixture of Global and Local Experts (MoGLE) to capture both holistic structure and fine-grained details, and a dynamic gating network for adaptive fusion.  
  
The results are striking: Face-MoGLE achieves state-of-the-art performance across various benchmarks, delivering incredibly high-quality, controllable face generations. Whether it's Mask2Face, Text2Face, or multimodal generation, Face-MoGLE offers precise control. What's more, it boasts robust zero-shot generalization and can even produce faces that fool current forgery detection systems â€“ prompting the authors to plan future releases of dedicated detection models.  
  
It's fantastic to see the full research ecosystem openly shared on Hugging Face! You can explore the paper, dive into the code, try the interactive demo, and use the models and datasets yourself.  
  
This is a prime example of how sharing all your artifacts openly on the Hugging Face Hub accelerates research and collaboration in AI. We encourage more researchers to follow this path!
