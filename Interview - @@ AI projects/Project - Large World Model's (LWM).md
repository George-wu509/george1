This could be Large World Model's (LWM) [hashtag#Veo3](https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/all/?keywords=%23veo3&origin=HASH_TAG_FROM_FEED) moment. [Google](https://www.linkedin.com/company/google/) released Genie 3 -- an interactive world generation model. Some points to note:  
  
1) Video models do not generate actual worlds, rather a temporal sequence of 2D pixels. The worlds that they generate are not interactive not consistent.  
  
2) Large World Models change that and generate 3D interactive worlds with global consistency (an object will not disappear when you come back to it). Moreover, you can interact with the world as a playable character in that world.  
  
3) LWMs are critical for getting to AGI and the path to AGI has to go from LLM -> VLM (vision language models) -> LWM (large world models) -> LAM (large action models).
