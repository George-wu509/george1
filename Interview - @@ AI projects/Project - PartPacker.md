You can now generate 3D models from a single image with NVIDIA’s new PartPacker.  
  
It’s a research model that turns one 2D photo into an articulated, editable 3D mesh with distinct parts.  
  
▸ Uses dual-volume packing for clean, non-overlapping parts  
▸ Runs faster and outputs higher-quality part separation than previous methods  
▸ Outputs are animation-ready and easy to manipulate  
▸ Live demo available on Hugging Face  
▸ Open-source code provided
