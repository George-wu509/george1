Some big news for optimization…  
  
Gurobi’s first GPU-accelerated solver is here! (Alpha Release)  
  
Big milestone for us at Gurobi! We’ve just released an alpha version of our first GPU-accelerated solver, powered by the PDHG algorithm running on NVIDIA GPUs.  
  
This marks the beginning of a new chapter: bringing GPU acceleration into mathematical optimization. While still experimental and focused on giant-scale LPs, it opens up a future where some of the hardest problems in industry can be solved faster and at larger scales than ever before.  
  
🔹 Available in Gurobi 12.0.3 (Linux only, NVIDIA H100 or newer)  
🔹 Designed for benchmarking and exploration (not yet production-ready)  
🔹 Downloadable today from the Gurobi Download Center for commercial and academic license holders  
  
For me, this is a glimpse at where optimization is headed. GPUs have already transformed fields like AI and deep learning. Now we’re beginning to explore what they can do for operations research and decision intelligence.  
  
I’d love to hear from our community:  
👉 What “giant” models are you excited to test with GPU acceleration?  
👉 Where do you see the biggest opportunities for solver + GPU synergy?
