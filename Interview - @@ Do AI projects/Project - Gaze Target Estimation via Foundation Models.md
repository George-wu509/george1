Gaze-LLE: Gaze Target Estimation via Foundation Models 👁️ 👁️ 👁️  
  
Gaze-LLE is easily one of my favorite CVPR 2025 papers. Developed by [Fiona Ryan]estimation by building on top of a frozen DINOv2 visual foundation model.  
  
Traditional gaze target estimation models rely on complex, multi-branch pipelines: separate encoders for head and scene, plus extra networks for pose or depth cues. These hand-crafted systems are often heavy and slow to train.  
  
Gaze-LLE simplifies the process by using a single feature representation from a frozen DINOv2 encoder, along with a simple head prompt that specifies whose gaze to estimate.
