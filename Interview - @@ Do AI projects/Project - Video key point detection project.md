As a basketball and computer vision fan, I've always been fascinated by the idea of replacing referees with AI. Automating complex rules like the 3-second violation is challenging, and requires a lot of moving parts. But last week, [Alexander Bodner](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexanderbodner/) and I finally got an MVP algorithm working!  
  
The best part is that all three models we used to build this project are fully open-source and available under the Apache 2.0 license:  
  
- RF-DETR â€“ for ball, number, player, referee, and basket detection.  
- SAM2 â€“ for player segmentation and tracking.  
- ViTPose++ â€“ for player pose estimation.

You'll find links to my basketball player detection, ball keypoint detection models, as well as an end-to-end blog post explaining every step of the algorithm, in the comments below
