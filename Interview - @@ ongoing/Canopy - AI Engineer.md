Responsibilities:  

- Use machine learning techniques to train, debug, and evaluate models for customer deliveries ranging from quick prototypes to full production-level models.
- Perform exploratory data analysis on the large sensory datasets (image, audio, radar) we have gathered, to develop greater understanding of the problem domain.
- Define and improve best practices of ML systems development, testing and evaluation.
- Work closely with data collection teams, Data and MLOps engineers, and Quality Assurance to improve the quality of our datasets and pipelines.
- Work with product managers to help integrate the machine learning solutions and deliver on the desired user experience.  
      
      
    

**Requirements  
  
**

- 3+ years’ experience and knowledge of applying machine learning or statistical techniques to solve real-world problems, ideally within the computer vision or audio domain (e.g., presence detection, speech processing, etc.).
- Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, Data Science, Engineering, or a related field
- Strong experience using Python and common data and machine learning-related libraries, such as Keras/TensorFlow or Pytorch, numpy, scipy, Pandas, etc.
- Proficient experience with C++ and running optimised machine learning-based applications on edge hardware.
- Proficiency using the command line including shell scripting, ideally in a Unix-based environment (e.g. Linux, macOS).
- Knowledge of basic signal processing techniques.  
      
      
    

Preferred Qualifications:  
  

- Experience in deploying models to edge hardware, including experience with PyTorch and ONNX and model compression techniques, e.g. quantisation and pruning.
- Reside within the Detroit area or nearby, with the ability to work in a hybrid environment and regularly commute to our Detroit office as needed.
- Experience using cloud computing platforms, e.g., AWS or GCP desired.
